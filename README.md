# gdalwebsrv

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of gdalwebsrv is to provide access to some online image servers
using standard tools.

This package contains no code for *reading rasters*, itâ€™s simply a
convenient way to access *configuration files* that can be used as
sources of web imagery.

WIP, currently pretty limited there are only 5 sources (from 17 ) that
we allow in for now while things are figured out.

## Installation

``` r
remotes::install_github("hypertidy/gdalwebsrv")
```

You can install the released version of gdalwebsrv from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("gdalwebsrv")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(gdalwebsrv)

available_sources()
#>  [1] "wms_arcgis_mapserver_ESRI.WorldImagery_tms"
#>  [2] "wms_arcgis_terrain_tms_lerc"               
#>  [3] "wms_bluemarble_s3_tms"                     
#>  [4] "wms_googlemaps_hybrid_tms"                 
#>  [5] "wms_googlemaps_satellite_tms"              
#>  [6] "wms_googlemaps_terrain_tms"                
#>  [7] "wms_googlemaps_terrainextra_tms"           
#>  [8] "wms_googlemaps_tms"                        
#>  [9] "wms_openstreetmap_tms"                     
#> [10] "wms_virtualearth"

srcfile <- server_file("wms_googlemaps_tms")

library(gdalio)
g <- gdalio_graphics(srcfile)
plot(g)
```

``` r
gdalio_set_default_grid(list(extent = c(-1, 1, -1, 1) * 1e6, 
                            dimension = c(1024, 1024), 
                            projection = "+proj=laea +lon_0=147 +lat_0=-42"))
l <- gdalio_graphics(srcfile)
plot(l)
```
